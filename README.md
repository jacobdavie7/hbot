My colletion of bash scripts combined into one script to help make my (and your) life that much easier.
<br>
<br>
This is a constant work in progress so be prepared for stuff to break and many updates.
<br>
<br>
Not all updates will get a new package realease. When I am working on this project, they come way to fast for that. I finally turned this into a package mostly becuase I was tired of navingating to the script :)
<br>
<br>
Most of the functions are highly customized for me, my specific use case and setup. I would reccomend looking though the functions, understand what they are doing and make modifications that work for you and your enviroment.
